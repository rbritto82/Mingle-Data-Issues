# Mingle-Data-Preparation
Preparation of data extracted from Mingle.

# Instructions
Before run the script, update the data using the Mingle extraction plugin. To do so, we use the spreadsheets available in Dashboard > Data > Mingle > Directory.
Always use the file tagged as "current". After update the file, create a copy of the curren spreadsheet and tag it using the defined convention (yyyymmdd).
If it is necessary to update any MQL query, update the associated query file, which is available at Dashboard > Data > Mingle > Queries.
