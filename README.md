# Mingle-Data-Preparation
Preparation of data extracted from Mingle.

# Instructions
Before run the script, update the data using the Mingle extraction plugin. To do so, we use the spreadsheets available in Dashboard > Data > Mingle > Directory.

Once you have updated the data, export a CSV file.

If it is necessary to update any MQL query, update the spreadsheet and the associated query file, which is available at Dashboard > Data > Mingle > Queries.
